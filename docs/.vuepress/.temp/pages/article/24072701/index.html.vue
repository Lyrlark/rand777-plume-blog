<template><div><p>Language is a tool for communication and <strong>broadening</strong> horizons.I think the <strong>ultimate goal</strong>
is to be able to <strong>converse reflexively</strong> in English and to write freely that you want to express.
So how to improve English skill efficiently?Below are my methods:</p>
<h4 id="step1-write-down-your-thoughts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step1-write-down-your-thoughts"><span>Step1:Write Down Your Thoughts</span></a></h4>
<p>You need to record everything that <strong>comes to mind</strong>,whether maybe it's about your daily life,
work troubles,or study <strong>concerns</strong>.
During this process, there's no need to worry about <strong>grammar</strong> or spelling errors.
If you <strong>encounter</strong> a word you can't spell while writing, you can <strong>substitute</strong> it with a word from your native language.<br>
<em>e.g.Teacher,I am extremely eager to 进步.</em></p>
<h4 id="step2-look-up-the-words-you-can-t-spell" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step2-look-up-the-words-you-can-t-spell"><span>Step2:Look Up the Words You Can't Spell</span></a></h4>
<p>After all of your thoughts written down,you should replace the words you couldn't spell with the correct ones
and highlight or <strong>emphasize</strong> these words.
These words represent your weak points, which you need to <strong>memorize</strong>.<br>
<em>e.g.Teacher,I am extremely eager to <strong>make progress</strong>.</em></p>

<p>Lastly, you can seek <strong>modification</strong> suggestions from AI. Let it help you choose better words
and correct any grammatical errors in your sentences.</p>
