Language is a tool for communication and **broadening** horizons.I think the **ultimate goal** 
is to be able to **converse reflexively** in English and to write freely that you want to express.
So how to improve English skill efficiently?Below are my methods:
#### Step1:Write Down Your Thoughts
You need to record everything that **comes to mind**,whether maybe it's about your daily life,
work troubles,or study **concerns**.
During this process, there's no need to worry about **grammar** or spelling errors.
If you **encounter** a word you can't spell while writing, you can **substitute** it with a word from your native language.  
*e.g.Teacher,I am extremely eager to 进步.*
#### Step2:Look Up the Words You Can't Spell
After all of your thoughts written down,you should replace the words you couldn't spell with the correct ones 
and highlight or **emphasize** these words.
These words represent your weak points, which you need to **memorize**.  
*e.g.Teacher,I am extremely eager to **make progress**.*
#### Step3:Seek Modification Suggestions from AI
Lastly, you can seek **modification** suggestions from AI. Let it help you choose better words 
and correct any grammatical errors in your sentences.
